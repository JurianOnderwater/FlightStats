# FlightStats ‚úàÔ∏è

A modern, local-first Progressive Web App (PWA) to visualise, track, and analyse your personal flight history. Built with a Python Flask backend (for serving) and a dynamic JavaScript frontend, this application turns your travel data into an interactive and insightful dashboard, all while keeping your data private on your own device.

## ## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Interactive Map Visualisation:** View all your flights as curved, great-circle arcs on an interactive map. Each airport is marked with a dot and its IATA code label.
* **Local-First Data Storage:** Your flight data is stored securely and privately in your browser using **IndexedDB**. Nothing is uploaded to a central server, making the app fast and offline-capable.
* **Comprehensive Statistics Dashboard:**
    * **Hero Stats:** At-a-glance view of your total flights, countries, airports, and unique routes.
    * **Distance Analytics:** See your total distance flown in km and miles, how many times you've circumnavigated the Earth, and what percentage of the journey to the moon you've completed.
    * **Time Analytics:** An estimation of your total hours, days, weeks, and months spent in the air.
    * **Top 10 Lists:** Automatically generated leaderboards for your most visited airports and most flown routes.
* **Full CRUD Functionality:** Easily **add**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** flights from your travel history.
* **Data Portability:** **Import** and **export** your entire flight history with the click of a button using the universal CSV format.
* **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Installable on any device (desktop or mobile) for a native app-like experience, complete with offline access.
* **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, responsive interface built with Google's **Material 3** design principles, including a custom green theme.

## ## Advanced Visualisation

#### **1. 3D Globe View 🌎**
This is a big but very rewarding challenge. Instead of the 2D Leaflet map, you could create a new view using a library like **CesiumJS** or **deck.gl**. This would let you render your flight paths as beautiful, glowing arcs on a fully interactive 3D globe. For someone with your computer science background, this would be an impressive feature to build.



#### **2. Airport Heatmap 🔥**
Instead of just dots, you could add a "Heatmap" toggle to the map view. Using a Leaflet plugin, you could visualise your most frequented airports and regions as "hotspots". A bright red spot over London would instantly show that it's a major hub in your travels.

## ## Deeper Insights & Gamification

#### **3. "Firsts" and Achievements 🏆**
Add a new section or page that automatically calculates and displays milestones from your flight data. This adds a fun, game-like element to your history. The app could track:
* **First flight** logged.
* **Longest and shortest** flights.
* **Milestone distances** (e.g., "You've flown 100,000 km!").
* **Continents visited:** A checklist of continents you've landed in.
* **New airports/countries** visited each year.

#### **4. The "Arctic Traveler" Stat ❄️**
Since you're based in Tromsø, you could add a unique, personalised stat card. It could track all of your flights that cross the **Arctic Circle (66.5° N latitude)**. You could display stats like "Total Arctic Flights" or "Furthest North Airport Visited." This would make the app uniquely yours.

## ## UI/UX & Quality of Life

#### **5. Dark Mode 🌙**
A classic and highly requested feature for any modern app. Material 3 is built for theming, so you could add a toggle that switches your custom green theme to a dark variant. This is a great design polish that improves usability in low-light conditions.

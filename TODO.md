# FlightStats TODO List

A list of potential features and improvements for the application.

---

## ## Advanced Visualisation

- [ ] **3D Globe View** 🌎
  > Create a new view using a library like **CesiumJS** or **deck.gl** to render flight paths on a fully interactive 3D globe.

- [ ] **Airport Heatmap** 🔥
  > Add a "Heatmap" toggle to the map view using a Leaflet plugin to visualise the most frequented airports and regions.

---

## ## Deeper Insights & Gamification

- [ ] **"Firsts" and Achievements** 🏆
  > Add a new section or page that automatically calculates and displays milestones from flight data.
  - [ ] Track first flight logged.
  - [ ] Track longest and shortest flights.
  - [ ] Track milestone distances (e.g., 100,000 km).
  - [ ] Create a checklist of continents visited.
  - [ ] Track new airports/countries visited each year.

  ** Year-over-Year Comparison View 📊 **
  - [ ] Create a new view on your stats page that lets you compare your travel between any two years. You could have two dropdown menus to select the years, and the page would show a side-by-side comparison of key metrics:

  - [ ] Total Flights

  - [ ] Total Distance

  - [ ] New Countries Visited

This would let you easily see how your travel patterns have evolved over time.

## ## UI/UX & Quality of Life

- [ ] **Dark Mode** 🌙
  > Implement a toggle that switches the custom green theme to a dark variant using Material 3's theming capabilities.
- [ ] **Filter chips**
  > Make clicking a filter chip deselect all other chips, or something in that direction
- [ ] **Mobile friendly UI**
